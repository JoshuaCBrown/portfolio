Bro (possibly w for hat hair) could be face os are eyes rs are smiles Bs are fingers which multiply and then say high (possibly hs could be legs crossed) 

ns and Ds could also be smiley face
os and Js could be eyes and frowny face

hs could be astronaut helmet looking down into ss and o or tv screen with change in perspective from top starting persp 

zoom in on ns is a door (or hs)

zoom in on o in brown it's a portal or porthole 


change in perspective where camera comes around side until upright text is vertical line shadow is horizontal line L shape
