      My name is Josh Brown and I am a developer, musician, and creative based in Atlanta, GA. I built this website to feature some of personal and professional projects. If you are interested in working with me, want to offer constructive feedback on something you see here, have a question, or just want to drop a line, please don't hestitate to reach out! I look forward to connecting.  

      {/* The things I appreciate about music and woodworking are the same things I love about programming: the creative problem solving, the endless supply of new information and areas to explore, and the ability to bring an abstract idea to life in a tangible form. While I'm relatively early in my coding journey, I will hopefully soon find the right opportunity to grow as a professional developer doing something that is both personally fulfilling and professionally impactful.    */}
