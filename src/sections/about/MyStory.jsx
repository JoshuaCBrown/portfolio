      The things I appreciate about music and woodworking are the same things I love about programming: the creative problem solving, the endless supply of new information and areas to explore, and the ability to bring an abstract idea to life in a tangible form. While I'm relatively early in my coding journey, I will hopefully soon find the right opportunity to grow as a professional developer doing something that is both personally fulfilling and professionally impactful.
